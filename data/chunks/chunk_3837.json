Consider the random variable\nX : Ω →T and a subset S ⊆T (for example, a single element of T,\nsuch as the outcome that one head is obtained when tossing two coins).\nLet X−1(S) be the pre-image of Sby X, i.e., the set of elements of Ω that", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
