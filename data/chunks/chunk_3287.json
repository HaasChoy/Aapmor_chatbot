In this chapter, we will add some geomet-\nric interpretation and intuition to all of these concepts. In particular, we\nwill look at geometric vectors and compute their lengths and distances\nor angles between two vectors. To be able to do this, we equip the vec-\ntor space with an inner product that induces the geometry of the vector", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
