Intuitively , this means that there are some redundancies.\nIn the following, we will exploit this and turn theD×Dcovariance matrix\ninto an N ×N covariance matrix whose eigenvalues are all positive.\nIn PCA, we ended up with the eigenvector equation\nSbm = λmbm, m = 1,...,M, (10.54)\nwhere bm is a basis vector of the principal subspace. Let us rewrite this\nequation a bit: With Sdeﬁned in (10.53), we obtain\nSbm = 1\nNXX⊤bm = λmbm.
