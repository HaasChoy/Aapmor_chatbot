It is possible to very quickly narrow down the options by working\nthrough a series of questions about your time series forecasting problem. By considering a few\nthemes and questions within each theme, you narrow down the type of problem, test harness,\nand even choice of algorithms for your project. In this tutorial, you will discover a framework\nthat you can use to quickly understand and frame your time series forecasting problem.
