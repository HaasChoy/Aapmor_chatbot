In this section, we will see how to use probability distribu-\ntions to model our uncertainty due to the observation process and our\nuncertainty in the parameters of our predictors. In Section 8.3.1, we in-\ntroduce the likelihood, which is analogous to the concept of loss functions\n(Section 8.2.2) in empirical risk minimization. The concept of priors (Sec-\ntion 8.3.2) is analogous to the concept of regularization (Section 8.2.3).\n8.3.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
