They are often researchers who need to understand\nthe mathematical basis of machine learning and uncover relationships be-\ntween different tasks. This is similar to composers of music who, within\nthe rules and structure of musical theory , create new and amazing pieces.\nWe hope this book provides a high-level overview of other technical books", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
