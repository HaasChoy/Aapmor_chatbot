What we effectively perform is a change of basis from (b1,b2) to\n(c1,c2), and we are looking for the transformation matrix that implements", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
