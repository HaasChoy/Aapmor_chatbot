The Gram-Schmidt algorithm (Section 3.8.3) is a method\nfor iteratively constructing an orthogonal/orthonormal basis from a set of\nbasis vectors using such linear combinations. Therefore, even ifx1 and x2\nare not orthogonal, we can apply the Gram-Schmidt algorithm and ﬁnd\neigenvectors associated with λ1 = 1 that are orthogonal to each other", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
