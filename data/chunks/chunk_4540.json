Since the likelihood (9.5b) is a product of\nN Gaussian distributions, the log-transformation is useful since (a) it does\nnot suffer from numerical underﬂow, and (b) the differentiation rules will\nturn out simpler. More speciﬁcally , numerical underﬂow will be a prob-\nlem when we multiply N probabilities, where N is the number of data\npoints, since we cannot represent very small numbers, such as 10−256.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
