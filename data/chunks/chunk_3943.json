(6.45)\nWe see that (6.45) is twice the raw-score expression (6.44). This means\nthat we can express the sum of pairwise distances (of which there are N2\nof them) as a sum of deviations from the mean (of which there areN). Ge-\nometrically , this means that there is an equivalence between the pairwise\ndistances and the distances from the center of the set of points.
