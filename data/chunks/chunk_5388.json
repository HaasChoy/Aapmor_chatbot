Then, the deep architecture allows multiple layers of these processing\nunits to be stacked, so that this deep learning model can characterize the salience of\nsignals in diﬀerent scales.\n— Deep Convolutional Neural Networks On Multichannel Time Series For Human Activity", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 22, "page_label": "6"}}
