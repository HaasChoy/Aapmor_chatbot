After the optimization, i.e., when we obtain the best pos-\nsible parameters θ∗, we distinguish three different cases: (i) overﬁtting,\n(ii) underﬁtting, and (iii) ﬁtting well. We will give a high-level intuition\nof what these three concepts mean.\nRoughly speaking, overﬁtting refers to the situation where the para- overﬁtting\nmetrized model class is too rich to model the dataset generated by M∗,\ni.e., Mθ could model much more complicated datasets.
