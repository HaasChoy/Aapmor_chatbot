The generative\nprocess allows us to integrate the model parameters out instead of condi-\ntioning on them, which addresses overﬁtting issues. Since this integration\nis analytically intractable, Bishop (1999) proposes to use approximate in-\nference methods, such as MCMC or variational inference. We refer to the\nwork by Gilks et al. (1996) and Blei et al.
