In our example, fmaps the coordinate represen-\ntation of any vector x ∈R2 with respect to (b1,b2) onto the coordinate\nrepresentation y ∈R2 with respect to (c1,c2). We want to identify the\nmapping so that we can compute how an area (or volume) changes when\nit is being transformed by f. For this, we need to ﬁnd out how f(x)\nchanges if we modify xa bit.
