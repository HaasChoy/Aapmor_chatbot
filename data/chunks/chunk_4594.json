For p = 1 , the regularizer is called LASSO LASSO\n(least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and was proposed by Tib-\nshirani (1996). ♦\nThe regularizer λ∥θ∥\n2\n2 in (9.32) can be interpreted as a negative log-\nGaussian prior, which we use in MAP estimation; see (9.26). More specif-\nically , with a Gaussian prior p(θ) = N\n(\n0, b2I\n)\n, we obtain the negative\nlog-Gaussian prior\n−log p(θ) = 1\n2b2 ∥θ∥\n2\n2 + const (9.33)", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
