Unlike other machine learning\nalgorithms, convolutional neural networks are capable of automatically learning features from\nsequence data, support multiple-variate data, and can directly output a vector for multi-step\nforecasting. As such, one-dimensional CNNs have been demonstrated to perform well and even\nachieve state-of-the-art results on challenging sequence prediction problems.
