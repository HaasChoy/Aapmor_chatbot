Intuitively , they are\nsets contained in the original vector space with the property that when\nwe perform vector space operations on elements within this subspace, we\nwill never leave it. In this sense, they are “closed”. Vector subspaces are a\nkey idea in machine learning. For example, Chapter 10 demonstrates how\nto use vector subspaces for dimensionality reduction.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
