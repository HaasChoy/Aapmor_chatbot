(2.49)\nThe key idea for ﬁnding the solutions of Ax = 0 is to look at the non-\npivot columns, which we will need to express as a (linear) combination of\nthe pivot columns. The reduced row echelon form makes this relatively\nstraightforward, and we express the non-pivot columns in terms of sums\nand multiples of the pivot columns that are on their left: The second col-\numn is 3 times the ﬁrst column (we can ignore the pivot columns on the", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
