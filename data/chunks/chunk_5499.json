Sliding Window With Multiple Variates 27\nâ€” Page 1, Multivariate Time Series Analysis: With R and Financial Applications , 2013.\nThe sweet spot for using machine learning for time series is where classical methods fall\ndown. This may be with complex univariate time series, and is more likely with multivariate\ntime series given the additional complexity. Below is another worked example to make the\nsliding window method concrete for multivariate time series.
