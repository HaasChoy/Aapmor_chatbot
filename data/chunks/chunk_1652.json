The diagonal has bolh signs! \nThe diagonal entries are a third set of numbers and we say nothing about them. \nH ere is a proof that the pivots and eigenvalues have matching signs. when \nA = AT . You see it best when the pivots are divided out of tbe rows of U. and \nA = LDL T. The diagonal pivot matrix D goes between triangular matrices Land LT:", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Paper Capture Plug-in", "creator": "PyPDF", "creationdate": "2010-03-03T12:24:37+00:00", "author": "", "moddate": "2010-05-26T00:47:43-03:00", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Introduction to Linear Algebra, 3rd edition (Gilbert Strang) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 578, "page": 332, "page_label": "333"}}
