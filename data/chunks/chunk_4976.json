Then a bar is drawn at the center of each bin, and the height\nof the bar is proportional to the number of data points within that bin. The\nbin size is a critical hyperparameter, and a bad choice can lead to overﬁt-\nting and underﬁtting. Cross-validation, as discussed in Section 8.2.4, can\nbe used to determine a good bin size. kernel density", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
