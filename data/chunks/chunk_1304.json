If A is the 10 by 10 all-oncs matrix. how does the big formula give detA = O? \n2. If you multiply all n! permutations tog~ther inlo a si ngl~ P. is it odd or even? \n3. If you multiply each aji by the fmelion 1. why is del A unchanged? \nSo luliOfi In Question 1. with all ajj = I. all the products in the big formula (8) \nwill be I. Half of them come with a plus sign. and half with minus.
