One particularly useful way to\nobtain an approximate gradient is by using a stochastic approximation,\nwhich we discuss next.\n7.1.3 Stochastic Gradient Descent\nComputing the gradient can be very time consuming. However, often it is\npossible to ﬁnd a “cheap” approximation of the gradient. Approximating\nthe gradient is still useful as long as it points in roughly the same direction", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
