In this case, we can see a further drop in the overall RMSE, suggesting that further tuning\nof the input size and perhaps the kernel size of the model may result in better performance.\nNote: Given the stochastic nature of the algorithm, your speciﬁc results may vary. Consider\nrunning the example a few times.\ncnn: [396.497] 392.2, 412.8, 384.0, 389.0, 387.3, 381.0, 427.1", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 394, "page_label": "378"}}
