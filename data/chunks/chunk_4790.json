If there are no duplicate data points,\nthe rank of the covariance matrixSis N, so it has D−N+ 1many eigen-\nvalues that are 0. Intuitively , this means that there are some redundancies.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
