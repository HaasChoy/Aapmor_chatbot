From T{11j) = 111, the first column of A contains 1 \nand O. The second basis vector U2 is along the perpendicular line (135°). This b<lsis ,'ector \nprojects to uro. So the second column of A contains 0 and 0: \nProjedion A = [~ ~] w hen V and W have the 45° and 135° basis.", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Paper Capture Plug-in", "creator": "PyPDF", "creationdate": "2010-03-03T12:24:37+00:00", "author": "", "moddate": "2010-05-26T00:47:43-03:00", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Introduction to Linear Algebra, 3rd edition (Gilbert Strang) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 578, "page": 383, "page_label": "384"}}
