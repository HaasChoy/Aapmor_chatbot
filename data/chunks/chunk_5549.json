Exponential Smoothing Methods 35\n5.3 Exponential Smoothing Methods\nExponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method for univariate data that can be\nextended to support data with a systematic trend or seasonal component. It is a powerful\nforecasting method that may be used as an alternative to the popular Box-Jenkins ARIMA\nfamily of methods.
