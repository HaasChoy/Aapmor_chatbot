We would like to ﬁnd good predic-\ntors given training data, and there are two main strategies for doing so:\nﬁnding the best predictor based on some measure of quality (sometimes\ncalled ﬁnding a point estimate), or using Bayesian inference. Finding a\npoint estimate can be applied to both types of predictors, but Bayesian", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
