We can see that the\nX component has a three-dimensional structure. The ﬁrst dimension is the number of samples,\nin this case 7. The second dimension is the number of time steps per sample, in this case 3, the\nvalue speciﬁed to the function. Finally, the last dimension speciﬁes the number of parallel time\nseries or the number of variables, in this case 2 for the two parallel series.
