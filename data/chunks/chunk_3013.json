The idea is that vectors that\nare similar should be predicted to have similar outputs by our machine\nlearning algorithm (our predictor). To formalize the idea of similarity be-\ntween vectors, we need to introduce operations that take two vectors as\ninput and return a numerical value representing their similarity . The con-\nstruction of similarity and distances is central to analytic geometry and isanalytic geometry\ndiscussed in Chapter 3.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
