Gradient Boosting and Extra Trees perform the best with about 87% and 86% accuracy,\nabout seven points below the best performing models on the feature-engineered version of\nthe dataset. It is encouraging that the Extra Trees ensemble method performed well on both\ndatasets; it suggests it and similar tree ensemble methods may be suited to the problem, at\nleast in this simpliÔ¨Åed framing. We can also see the drop of SVM to about 72% accuracy.
