We described how to go from one comer to a better neighbor. \nWe did not describe bow to find the first comer-which is easy in this example but \nnOI always. One way is to create new variables X5 and X6, which begin at 4 and 2 \n(with all the original x's at zero). Then start the simple)!: method with X5 + X6 as the \ncost. Switch to the original problem after xs and X6 reach zero-a starting comer for \nthe original problem has been found \nProblem Set 8.4", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Paper Capture Plug-in", "creator": "PyPDF", "creationdate": "2010-03-03T12:24:37+00:00", "author": "", "moddate": "2010-05-26T00:47:43-03:00", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Introduction to Linear Algebra, 3rd edition (Gilbert Strang) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 578, "page": 444, "page_label": "445"}}
