A symmetric matrix S∈Rn×n can always be diagonalized.\nTheorem 4.21 follows directly from the spectral theorem 4.15. More-\nover, the spectral theorem states that we can ﬁnd an ONB of eigenvectors\nof Rn. This makes P an orthogonal matrix so that D= P⊤AP.\nRemark. The Jordan normal form of a matrix offers a decomposition that\nworks for defective matrices (Lang, 1987) but is beyond the scope of this", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
