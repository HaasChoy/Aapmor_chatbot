It has been referred to as the\n“fundamental theorem of linear algebra” (Strang, 1993) because it can be\napplied to all matrices, not only to square matrices, and it always exists.\nMoreover, as we will explore in the following, the SVD of a matrix A,\nwhich represents a linear mapping Φ : V →W, quantiﬁes the change\nbetween the underlying geometry of these two vector spaces.
