A quick test is given by the upper left determinants: a > 0 and IIC - b2 > O. \n3. The quadratic function f = x T Ax then has a minimum at x = 0: \nX T A x = ax! + 2bn' + cl is positive except at (x. y) = (0. 0). \n4. The ellipse xTA :t = I has its a.,es along the eigenvectors of A . \nS. Coming: AT A is automatically positive definite if A has independent columns.", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Paper Capture Plug-in", "creator": "PyPDF", "creationdate": "2010-03-03T12:24:37+00:00", "author": "", "moddate": "2010-05-26T00:47:43-03:00", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Introduction to Linear Algebra, 3rd edition (Gilbert Strang) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 578, "page": 345, "page_label": "346"}}
