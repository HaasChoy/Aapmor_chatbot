U , are eigenvectors of AT A and AA T. \nThen A Vj falls in the direelion of U j. and we now explain why. The last v's and u 's (in \nIhe nullspaces) are easier. As long as those are orthonormal. the SVO will be correct. \nProof of SVD: Start from ATA ul = ulul. w hich gives the 11 '5 and u's. To prove \nIhat A Ui = UjU i. Ihe key sleps are to multiply by uT and by A: \n(10)", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Paper Capture Plug-in", "creator": "PyPDF", "creationdate": "2010-03-03T12:24:37+00:00", "author": "", "moddate": "2010-05-26T00:47:43-03:00", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Introduction to Linear Algebra, 3rd edition (Gilbert Strang) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 578, "page": 365, "page_label": "366"}}
