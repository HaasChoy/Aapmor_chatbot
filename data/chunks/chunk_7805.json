First, we must deﬁne the CNN model using\nthe Keras deep learning library. The model requires a three-dimensional input with [samples,\ntimesteps, features].\nThis is exactly how we have loaded the data, where one sample is one window of the time\nseries data, each window has 128 time steps, and a time step has nine variables or features.
