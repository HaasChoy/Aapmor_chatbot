In Section 10.5, we explained how to do PCA when the in-\nput dimensionality D is signiﬁcantly greater than the number N of data\npoints. By exploiting the insight that PCA can be performed by computing\n(many) inner products, this idea can be pushed to the extreme by consid-\nering inﬁnite-dimensional features. The kernel trick is the basis of kernel kernel trick\nkernel PCAPCA and allows us to implicitly compute inner products between inﬁnite-", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
