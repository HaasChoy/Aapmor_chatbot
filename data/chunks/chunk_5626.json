Data Preparation Example 50\n6.4.3 Split Into Samples\nLSTMs need to process samples where each sample is a single sequence of observations. In this\ncase, 5,000 time steps is too long; LSTMs work better with 200-to-400 time steps. Therefore, we\nneed to split the 5,000 time steps into multiple shorter sub-sequences. There are many ways to\ndo this, and you may want to explore some depending on your problem.
