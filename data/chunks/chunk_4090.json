Recall\nfrom (5.58) that the Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives, and that\nthe existence of a nonzero determinant shows that we can invert the Ja-\ncobian. Recall the discussion in Section 4.1 that the determinant arises\nbecause our differentials (cubes of volume) are transformed into paral-\nlelepipeds by the Jacobian.
