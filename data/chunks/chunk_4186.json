That is for each equality constrainthj(x) = 0 we equivalently\nreplace it by two constraints hj(x) ⩽0 and hj(x) ⩾0. It turns out that\nthe resulting Lagrange multipliers are then unconstrained.\nTherefore, we constrain the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the\ninequality constraints in (7.28) to be non-negative, and leave the La-", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
