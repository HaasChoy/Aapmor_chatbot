Therefore, the order in which rotations are applied is important,\neven if they rotate about the same point. Only in two dimensions vector\nrotations are commutative, such that R(φ)R(θ) = R(θ)R(φ) for all\nφ,θ ∈[0,2π). They form an Abelian group (with multiplication) only if\nthey rotate about the same point (e.g., the origin).", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
