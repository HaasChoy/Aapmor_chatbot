This step is divided into\nthe evaluation of a single model and the evaluation of all of the models. We will evaluate a\nsingle model by ﬁrst ﬁtting it on the training dataset, making a prediction on the test dataset,\nand then evaluating the prediction using a metric. In this case we will use classiﬁcation accuracy\nthat will capture the performance (or error) of a model given the balance observations across", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 496, "page_label": "480"}}
