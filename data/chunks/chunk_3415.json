In optimization, orthogonal projections are often used to (iteratively)\nminimize residual errors. This also has applications in machine learning,\ne.g., in linear regression where we want to Ô¨Ånd a (linear) function that\nminimizes the residual errors, i.e., the lengths of the orthogonal projec-\ntions of the data onto the linear function (Bishop, 2006).
