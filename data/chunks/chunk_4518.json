Here, we will need to\nlook at different loss/objective functions (they determine what a “good”\nﬁt is) and optimization algorithms that allow us to minimize this loss.\nOverﬁtting and model selection. Overﬁtting is a problem when the\nregression function ﬁts the training data “too well” but does not gen-\neralize to unseen test data. Overﬁtting typically occurs if the underly-\ning model (or its parametrization) is overly ﬂexible and expressive; see", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
