One approach to implementing this model is to split each window of 128 time steps into\nsubsequences for the CNN model to process. For example, the 128 time steps in each window\ncan be split into four subsequences of 32 time steps.\n# reshape data into time steps of sub-sequences\nn_steps, n_length = 4, 32", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 547, "page_label": "531"}}
