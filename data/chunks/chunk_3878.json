The states z1,...,z d do not in principle have any\nstructure, i.e., there is usually no way to compare them, for example\nz1 = red ,z2 = green ,z3 = blue . However, in many machine learning\napplications discrete states take numerical values, e.g., z1 = −1.1,z2 =\n0.3,z3 = 1.5, where we could say z1 < z2 < z3.
