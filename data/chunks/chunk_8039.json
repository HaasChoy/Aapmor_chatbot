As you start to work on methods or expand your existing knowledge of algorithms you\nmay need help. This chapter points out some of the best sources of help.\nA.1 Applied Time Series\nThere are a wealth of good books on applied time series suitable for the machine learning\nperspective. Most are focused on time series using the R platform.
