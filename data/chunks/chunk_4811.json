With about550 PCs, we can essentially fully reconstruct the training\ndata that contains the digit “8” (some pixels around the boundaries show\nno variation across the dataset as they are always black).", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
