In the mul-\ntivariate case, we can do exactly the same. In the following, we will do\nexactly this. But let us start with some notation.\nConsider a function f : R2 → R of two variables x,y. We use the\nfollowing notation for higher-order partial derivatives (and for gradients):\n∂2f\n∂x2 is the second partial derivative of f with respect to x.\n∂nf", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
