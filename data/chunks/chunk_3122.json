We saw that systems of linear equations can be com-\npactly represented using matrix-vector notation (2.10). In the following,\nwe will have a closer look at vector spaces, i.e., a structured space in which\nvectors live.\nIn the beginning of this chapter, we informally characterized vectors as", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
