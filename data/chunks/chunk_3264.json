In Chapter 3, we will introduce the inner\nproduct, which induces a norm. These concepts allow us to deÔ¨Åne angles,\nlengths and distances, which we will use for orthogonal projections. Pro-\njections turn out to be key in many machine learning algorithms, such as\nlinear regression and principal component analysis, both of which we will\ncover in Chapters 9 and 10, respectively .\nExercises", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
