The concept of an inner product can be generalized to\nvectors with an inﬁnite number of entries (countably inﬁnite) and also\ncontinuous-valued functions (uncountably inﬁnite). Then the sum over\nindividual components of vectors (see Equation (3.5) for example) turns\ninto an integral.\nAn inner product of two functions u : R →R and v : R →R can be\ndeﬁned as the deﬁnite integral\n⟨u,v⟩:=\n∫ b\na\nu(x)v(x)dx (3.37)", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
