These are problems\ncomprised of a single series of observations and a model is required to learn from the series of\npast observations to predict the next value in the sequence. We will demonstrate a number of\nvariations of the LSTM model for univariate time series forecasting. This section is divided into\nsix parts; they are:\n1. Data Preparation\n2.
