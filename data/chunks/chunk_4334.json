In machine learning,\nthe penalty term is referred to as regularization. Regularization is a wayregularization\nto compromise between accurate solution of empirical risk minimization\nand the size or complexity of the solution.\nExample 8.3 (Regularized Least Squares)", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
