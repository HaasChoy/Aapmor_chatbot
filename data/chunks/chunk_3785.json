We are looking for a Taylor series expansion,\nwhich itself is a linear combination of polynomials. Therefore, we do not\nexpect the Taylor series expansion to contain terms of fourth or higher\norder to express a third-order polynomial. This means that it should be\nsufﬁcient to determine the ﬁrst four terms of (5.151) for an exact alterna-\ntive representation of (5.161).", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
