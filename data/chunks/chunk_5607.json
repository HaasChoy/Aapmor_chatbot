So, really, we are\nadding the dimension of features, where a univariate time series has only one feature.\nWhen deÔ¨Åning the input layer of your LSTM network, the network assumes you have one\nor more samples and requires that you specify the number of time steps and the number of\nfeatures. You can do this by specifying a tuple to the input shape argument.
