A reader familiar with other presentations of the margin would\nnotice that our deﬁnition of ∥w∥ = 1 is different from the standard\npresentation if the SVM was the one provided by Sch ¨olkopf and Smola\n(2002), for example. In Section 12.2.3, we will show the equivalence of\nboth approaches. ♦", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
