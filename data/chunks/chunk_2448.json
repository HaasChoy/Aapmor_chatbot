In Ihat case we remove the last row and column and \ncontinue with a smaller matrix to find the next eigenvalue. \nTw o extra ideas make this method a sucrcss. One is to shift the matri~ by a \nmultiple of I. befon: factoring into QR. 1ben RQ is shifted back: \nFactor A .. - CI< I into Q I< RI<. The next matri~ is Ak+t = RI< Q . + ckl. \nAHt has the same eigenvalues as Ak. and the same as the original A o = A.
