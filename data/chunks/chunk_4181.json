This is de-\nscribed in more detail in (7.27). ♦\nRecall that the difference between J(x) in (7.18) and the Lagrangian\nin (7.20b) is that we have relaxed the indicator function to a linear func-\ntion. Therefore, when λ⩾0, the Lagrangian L(x,λ) is a lower bound of\nJ(x). Hence, the maximum of L(x,λ) with respect to λis\nJ(x) = max\nλ⩾0\nL(x,λ) .
