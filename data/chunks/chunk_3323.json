Orthogonality is the generalization of the concept of perpendic-\nularity to bilinear forms that do not have to be the dot product. In our\ncontext, geometrically , we can think of orthogonal vectors as having a\nright angle with respect to a speciﬁc inner product. ♦\nExample 3.7 (Orthogonal Vectors)\nFigure 3.6 The\nangle ωbetween\ntwo vectors x,ycan\nchange depending\non the inner\nproduct.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
