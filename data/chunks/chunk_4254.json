The hope is that a\nreader would be able to learn the rudimentary forms of the language of\nmathematics from the ﬁrst part, which we will now use to describe and\ndiscuss machine learning. The second part of the book introduces four\npillars of machine learning:\nRegression (Chapter 9)\nDimensionality reduction (Chapter 10)\nDensity estimation (Chapter 11)", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
