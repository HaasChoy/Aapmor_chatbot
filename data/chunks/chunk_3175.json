Intuitively , the dimension of a vector space\ncan be thought of as the number of independent directions in this vector\nspace.The dimension of a\nvector space\ncorresponds to the\nnumber of its basis\nvectors.\nRemark. The dimension of a vector space is not necessarily the number\nof elements in a vector. For instance, the vector space V = span[\n[0\n1\n]\n] is\none-dimensional, although the basis vector possesses two elements. â™¦", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
