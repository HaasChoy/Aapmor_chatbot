When f(·) is a convex\nfunction, and when the constraints involvingg(·) and h(·) are convex sets,\nthis is called a convex optimization problem. In this setting, we have strongconvex optimization\nproblem", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
