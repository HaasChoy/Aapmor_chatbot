We illustrate how the mathematical concepts in-\ntroduced in the ﬁrst part of the book are the foundation for each pillar.\nBroadly speaking, chapters are ordered by difﬁculty (in ascending order).\nIn Chapter 8, we restate the three components of machine learning\n(data, models, and parameter estimation) in a mathematical fashion. In\naddition, we provide some guidelines for building experimental set-ups", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
