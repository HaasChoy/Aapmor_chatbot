This too applies to time series forecasting problems that involve\nmultivariate and multi-step forecasting, but it may be a little more challenging. In this section,\nwe will provide short examples of data preparation and modeling for multivariate multi-step\ntime series forecasting as a template to ease this challenge, speciﬁcally:\n1.
