Looking at the eigenspaces of a defective matrix, it follows that the\nsum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is less than n. Speciﬁcally , a de-\nfective matrix has at least one eigenvalueλi with an algebraic multiplicity\nm> 1 and a geometric multiplicity of less than m.\nRemark. A defective matrix cannot have ndistinct eigenvalues, as distinct", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
