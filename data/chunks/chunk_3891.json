The two factors are the marginal distribu-\ntion of the ﬁrst random variable p(x), and the conditional distribution\nof the second random variable given the ﬁrst p(y|x). Since the ordering\nof random variables is arbitrary in p(x,y), the product rule also implies\np(x,y) = p(x|y)p(y). To be precise, (6.22) is expressed in terms of the\nprobability mass functions for discrete random variables.
