The tech-\nnical wrinkle is that we need to deﬁne a scale at which to measure the\ndistance. A potential scale is to consider the scale of the data, i.e., the raw\nvalues of xn. There are problems with this, as we could change the units\nof measurement of xn and change the values in xn, and, hence, change\nthe distance to the hyperplane. As we will see shortly , we deﬁne the scale", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
