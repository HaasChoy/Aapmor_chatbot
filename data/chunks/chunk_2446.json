At present the QR method is the leader in eigenvalue \ncomputations and we describe it briefly. \nThe basic step is to factor A. whose eigenvalues we want. into QR. Remember \nfrom Gram-Schmidt (Section 4.4) that Q has onhononnal columns and R is triangular. \nFor eigenvalues the key idea is~ R Hen e Q and R. The new matri~ is RQ .
