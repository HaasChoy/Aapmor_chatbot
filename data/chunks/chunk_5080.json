Consider the set of examplesxn with the same label.\nWe would like to build a convex set that contains all the examples such\nthat it is the smallest possible set. This is called the convex hull and is\nillustrated in Figure 12.9.\nLet us ﬁrst build some intuition about a convex combination of points.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
