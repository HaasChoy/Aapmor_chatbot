TIle starting point is still a matri~ equation A x = b. But the only acceptable \nsolutions are IIOllllegaliu. We require x=:O (meaning that no component of x can be \nnegative). The matrix has n > m. more unknowns than equations. If there are any \nnonnegative solutions to A x = b. there are probably a lot.
