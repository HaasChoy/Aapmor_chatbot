For example, if ourxn are images with\n10,000 pixels (e.g., 100 ×100 pixel images), we would need to compute\nthe eigendecomposition of a 10,000 ×10,000 covariance matrix. In the\nfollowing, we provide a solution to this problem for the case that we have\nsubstantially fewer data points than dimensions, i.e., N ≪D.\nAssume we have a centered dataset x1,..., xN, xn ∈RD.
