This means that, given the same model conﬁguration\nand the same training dataset, a diﬀerent internal set of weights will result each time the model\nis trained that will in turn have a diﬀerent performance. This is a beneﬁt, allowing the model to\nbe adaptive and ﬁnd high performing conﬁgurations to complex problems.
