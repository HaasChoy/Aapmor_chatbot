The main mo-\ntivation for higher-dimensional representations is that we can construct\nnew features as non-linear combinations of the original features, which in", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
