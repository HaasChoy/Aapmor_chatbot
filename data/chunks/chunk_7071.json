Develop Naive Forecast Models 350\n17.5 Develop Naive Forecast Models\nIt is important to test naive forecast models on any new prediction problem. The results from\nnaive models provide a quantitative idea of how diï¬ƒcult the forecast problem is and provide a\nbaseline performance by which more sophisticated forecast methods can be evaluated. In this\nsection, we will develop and compare three naive forecast methods for the household power\nprediction problem; they are:", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 366, "page_label": "350"}}
