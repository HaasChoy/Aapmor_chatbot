Univariate LSTM Models 131\n9.2.5 CNN-LSTM\nA convolutional neural network, or CNN for short, is a type of neural network developed for\nworking with two-dimensional image data. The CNN can be very eï¬€ective at automatically\nextracting and learning features from one-dimensional sequence data such as univariate time\nseries data. A CNN model can be used in a hybrid model with an LSTM backend where the\nCNN is used to interpret subsequences of input that together are provided as a sequence to an", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 147, "page_label": "131"}}
