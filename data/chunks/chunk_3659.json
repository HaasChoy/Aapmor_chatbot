In Figure 5.3, these are the points with x-coordinates x0 and x0 + δx.\nThe difference quotient can also be considered the average slope of f\nbetween xand x+ δxif we assume f to be a linear function. In the limit\nfor δx →0, we obtain the tangent of f at x, if f is differentiable. The\ntangent is then the derivative of f at x.\nDeﬁnition 5.2 (Derivative).
