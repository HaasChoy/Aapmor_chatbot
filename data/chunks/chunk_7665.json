In the ﬁrst\nﬁgure, can see that each activity has a diﬀerent data distribution, with a marked diﬀerence\nbetween the large movement (ﬁrst three activities) with the stationary activities (last three\nactivities). Data distributions for the ﬁrst three activities look Gaussian with perhaps diﬀering\nmeans and standard deviations. Distributions for the latter activities look multi-modal (i.e.\nmultiple peaks).", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 482, "page_label": "466"}}
