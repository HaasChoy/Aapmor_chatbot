Every subspace U ⊆(Rn,+,·) is the solution space of a homo-\ngeneous system of homogeneous linear equations Ax = 0 for x ∈Rn.\n♦\n2.5 Linear Independence\nIn the following, we will have a close look at what we can do with vectors\n(elements of the vector space). In particular, we can add vectors together\nand multiply them with scalars. The closure property guarantees that we\nend up with another vector in the same vector space.
