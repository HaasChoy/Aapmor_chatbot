An important secondary beneﬁt of using CNNs is that they\ncan support multiple 1D inputs in order to make a prediction. This is useful if the multi-step\noutput sequence is a function of more than one input sequence. This can be achieved using two\ndiﬀerent model conﬁgurations.\n Multiple Input Channels . This is where each input sequence is read as a separate\nchannel, like the diﬀerent channels of an image (e.g. red, green and blue).", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 386, "page_label": "370"}}
