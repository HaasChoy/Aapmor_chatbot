For a univariate time series problem where we are interested in one-step\npredictions, the observations at prior time steps, so-called lag observations, are used as input\nand the output is the observation at the current time step. For example, the above 10-step\nunivariate series can be expressed as a supervised learning problem with three time steps for\ninput and one step as output, as follows:\nX, y\n[1, 2, 3], [4]\n[2, 3, 4], [5]\n[3, 4, 5], [6]\n...", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 59, "page_label": "43"}}
