Therefore, the error/loss function for each single example–\nlabel pair needs to be appropriate for binary classiﬁcation. For example,\nthe squared loss that is used for regression (9.10b) is not suitable for bi-\nnary classiﬁcation.\nRemark. The ideal loss function between binary labels is to count the num-\nber of mismatches between the prediction and the label.
