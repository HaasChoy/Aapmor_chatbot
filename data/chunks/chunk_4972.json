A Bayesian approach would place a prior on the param-\neters, which can be used to obtain a posterior distribution on the param-\neters. This posterior allows us to compute the model evidence (marginal\nlikelihood), which can be used for model comparison, which gives us a\nprincipled way to determine the number of mixture components. Un-\nfortunately , closed-form inference is not possible in this setting because\nthere is no conjugate prior for this model.
