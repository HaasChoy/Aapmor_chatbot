Audio signals are represented as a series of\nnumbers. We can add audio signals together, and their sum is a new\naudio signal. If we scale an audio signal, we also obtain an audio signal.\nTherefore, audio signals are a type of vector, too.\n4. Elements of Rn (tuples of n real numbers) are vectors.
