Given an objective\nfunction, Ô¨Ånding the best value is done using optimization algorithms. Since we consider\ndata and models in\nRD, the\noptimization\nproblems we face\nare continuous\noptimization\nproblems, as\nopposed to\ncombinatorial\noptimization\nproblems for\ndiscrete variables.\nThis chapter covers two main branches of continuous optimization (Fig-", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
