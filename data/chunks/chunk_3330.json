In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we used\ninner products to compute the length of vectors and the angle between\nvectors. In the following, we will discuss the special case where the basis\nvectors are orthogonal to each other and where the length of each basis", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
