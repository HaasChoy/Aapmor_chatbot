For example, an email client sorts\nmail into personal mail and junk mail, which has two outcomes. Another\nexample is a telescope that identiﬁes whether an object in the night sky\nis a galaxy , star, or planet. There are usually a small number of outcomes,\nand more importantly there is usually no additional structure on these", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
