The image is the set of vectors w∈W that\ncan be “reached” by Φ from any vector in V. An illustration is given in\nFigure 2.12.\nRemark. Consider a linear mapping Φ : V →W, where V,W are vector\nspaces.\nIt always holds that Φ(0V) = 0W and, therefore, 0V ∈ ker(Φ). In\nparticular, the null space is never empty .\nIm(Φ) ⊆W is a subspace of W, and ker(Φ) ⊆V is a subspace of V.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
