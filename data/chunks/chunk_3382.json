Recall that this means that bdoes not lie in\nthe span of A, i.e., the vector bdoes not lie in the subspace spanned by\nthe columns of A. Given that the linear equation cannot be solved exactly ,\nwe can ﬁnd an approximate solution. The idea is to ﬁnd the vector in the\nsubspace spanned by the columns ofAthat is closest tob, i.e., we compute\nthe orthogonal projection of bonto the subspace spanned by the columns", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
