Using the properties\nof the variance, which we discussed in Section 6.4.4, we obtain\nVz[z] = Vx[B⊤(x−µ)] = Vx[B⊤x−B⊤µ] = Vx[B⊤x] , (10.6)\ni.e., the variance of the low-dimensional code does not depend on the\nmean of the data. Therefore, we assume without loss of generality that the\ndata has mean 0 for the remainder of this section. With this assumption\nthe mean of the low-dimensional code is also0 since Ez[z] = Ex[B⊤x] =\nB⊤Ex[x] = 0. ♦", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
