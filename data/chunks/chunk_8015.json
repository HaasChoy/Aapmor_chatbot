This combination is called\na Convolutional LSTM, or ConvLSTM for short, and like the CNN-LSTM is also used for\nspatiotemporal data. The ConvLSTM2D class, by default, expects input data to have the shape:\n[samples, time, rows, cols, channels]. Where each time step of data is deﬁned as an\nimage of (rows × columns) data points.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 551, "page_label": "535"}}
