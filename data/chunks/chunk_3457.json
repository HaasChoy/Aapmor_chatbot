(4.20)\nGiven a linear mapping Φ : V →V, where V is a vector space, we\ndeﬁne the trace of this map by using the trace of matrix representation\nof Φ. For a given basis of V, we can describe Φ by means of the transfor-\nmation matrix A. Then the trace of Φ is the trace of A. For a different\nbasis of V, it holds that the corresponding transformation matrix Bof Φ\ncan be obtained by a basis change of the form S−1ASfor suitable S(see", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
