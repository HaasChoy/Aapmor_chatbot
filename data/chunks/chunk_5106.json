We consider two different approaches for Ô¨Ånding the optimal\nsolution for the SVM. First we consider the loss view of SVM 8.2.2 and ex-\npress this as an unconstrained optimization problem. Then we express the\nconstrained versions of the primal and dual SVMs as quadratic programs\nin standard form 7.3.2.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
