From (1)+(2),\nwe get 2x1 + 3x3 = 5, i.e., x3 = 1. From (3), we then get that x2 = 1.\nTherefore, (1,1,1) is the only possible and unique solution (verify that\n(1,1,1) is a solution by plugging in).\nAs a third example, we consider\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 3 (1)\nx1 − x2 + 2 x3 = 2 (2)\n2x1 + 3 x3 = 5 (3)\n. (2.6)\nSince (1)+(2)=(3), we can omit the third equation (redundancy).
