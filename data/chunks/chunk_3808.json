For example, when tossing a\nsingle coin, we cannot determine the outcome, but by doing a large num-\nber of coin tosses, we can observe a regularity in the average outcome.\nUsing this mathematical structure of probability , the goal is to perform\nautomated reasoning, and in this sense, probability generalizes logical\nreasoning (Jaynes, 2003).\n6.1.1 Philosophical Issues", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
