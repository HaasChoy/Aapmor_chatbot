Recall that diﬀerencing is the transform of the data such\nthat a value of a prior observation is subtracted from the current observation, removing trend\nor seasonality structure. We will add support for diﬀerencing to the grid search test harness,\njust in case it adds value to your speciﬁc problem. It does add value for the internal airline\npassengers dataset. The difference() function below will calculate the diﬀerence of a given\norder for the dataset.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 316, "page_label": "300"}}
