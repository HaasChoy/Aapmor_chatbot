We don't want AI to be small. we want AIIAI to be small. Hen: \nA2 /AI = .6/1 and the speed is n:asonable. For large matrices it often happens that \nIA2/AI I is \"ery close to I. Then the power method is too slow. \nIs then: a way !O find Ihe smallest eigenvalue-which is often the most imponant", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Paper Capture Plug-in", "creator": "PyPDF", "creationdate": "2010-03-03T12:24:37+00:00", "author": "", "moddate": "2010-05-26T00:47:43-03:00", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Introduction to Linear Algebra, 3rd edition (Gilbert Strang) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 578, "page": 480, "page_label": "481"}}
