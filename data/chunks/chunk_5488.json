Sliding Window 25\nListing 4.1: Example of a small contrived supervised learning dataset.\nIt is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training\ndataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct\nanswers; the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by\nmaking updates. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 41, "page_label": "25"}}
