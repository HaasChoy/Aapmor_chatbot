Instead\nof doing the full SVD factorization, we will now investigate how the SVD\nallows us to represent a matrixAas a sum of simpler (low-rank) matrices\nAi, which lends itself to a matrix approximation scheme that is cheaper\nto compute than the full SVD.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
