In particular, for convex loss functions that apply independently\nto each example, the conjugate loss is a convenient way to derive a dual\nproblem.\n7.4 Further Reading\nContinuous optimization is an active area of research, and we do not try\nto provide a comprehensive account of recent advances.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
