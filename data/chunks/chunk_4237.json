The ﬁrst challenge is the fact\nthat gradient descent is a ﬁrst-order algorithm, and does not use infor-\nmation about the curvature of the surface. When there are long valleys,\nthe gradient points perpendicularly to the direction of interest. The idea\nof momentum can be generalized to a general class of acceleration meth-", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
