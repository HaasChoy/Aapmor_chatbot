TheLASSO\nLaplace distribution is sharply peaked at zero (its ﬁrst derivative is discon-\ntinuous) and it concentrates its probability mass closer to zero than the\nGaussian distribution, which encourages parameters to be 0. Therefore,\nthe nonzero parameters are relevant for the regression problem, which is\nthe reason why we also speak of “variable selection”.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
