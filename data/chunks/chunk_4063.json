Another example, which is quite common in ma-\nchine learning, is, given that X1 and X2 are univariate standard normal,\nwhat is the distribution of 1\n2 (X1 + X2)?\nOne option to work out the distribution of 1\n2 (X1 + X2) is to calculate\nthe mean and variance of X1 and X2 and then combine them. As we saw\nin Section 6.4.4, we can calculate the mean and variance of resulting ran-\ndom variables when we consider afÔ¨Åne transformations of random vari-", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
