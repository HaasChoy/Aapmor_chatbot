The second performs the same operation on the feature maps created by the ﬁrst\nlayer, attempting to amplify any salient features. We will use 64 feature maps per convolutional\nlayer and read the input sequences with a kernel size of three time steps. The max pooling\nlayer simpliﬁes the feature maps by keeping 1\n4 of the values with the largest (max) signal.
