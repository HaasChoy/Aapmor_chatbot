The input time series are parallel because each series has\nan observation at the same time steps. We can demonstrate this with a simple example of two\nparallel input time series where the output series is the simple addition of the input series.\n# define input sequence\nin_seq1 = array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90])", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 151, "page_label": "135"}}
