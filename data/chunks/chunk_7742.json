We can see that both the ExtraTrees ensemble method\nand the Support Vector Machines nonlinear methods achieve a performance of about 94%\naccuracy on the test set. This is a great result, exceeding the reported 89% by SVM in the\noriginal paper.\nNote: Given the stochastic nature of the algorithm, your speciÔ¨Åc results may vary.
