Figure 11.7\nillustrates the effect of updating the mixture weights. Figure 11.7(a) is\nidentical to Figure 11.6(b) and shows the GMM density and its individual\ncomponents prior to updating the mixture weights. Figure 11.7(b) shows\nthe GMM density after updating the mixture weights.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
