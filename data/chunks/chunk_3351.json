In the following, we will focus on orthogonal projections,\nwhich we will use in Chapter 10 for linear dimensionality reduction and\nin Chapter 12 for classiÔ¨Åcation. Even linear regression, which we discuss\nin Chapter 9, can be interpreted using orthogonal projections. For a given\nlower-dimensional subspace, orthogonal projections of high-dimensional\ndata retain as much information as possible and minimize the difference/", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
