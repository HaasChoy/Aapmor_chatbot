There may be some beneﬁt in designing models\nto focus speciﬁcally on reducing the error of the harder to forecast days. It may be interesting\nto see if the variance across daily scores could be further reduced with a tuned model or perhaps\nan ensemble of multiple diﬀerent models. It may also be interesting to compare the performance\nfor a model that uses seven or even 21 days of input data to see if further gains can be made.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 400, "page_label": "384"}}
