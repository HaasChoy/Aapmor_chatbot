The\nstandard deviation is a little more than 134 sales, meaning a worse case model run that is 2\nor 3 standard deviations in error from the mean error may be worse than the naive model. A\nchallenge in using the MLP model is in harnessing the higher skill and minimizing the variance\nof the model across multiple runs.\nThis problem applies generally for neural networks.
