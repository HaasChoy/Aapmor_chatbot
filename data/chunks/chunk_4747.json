Consider Figure 10.7(b), where the principal\nsubspace is spanned by a single vector b. Geometrically speaking, ﬁnding\nthe optimal coordinates zcorresponds to ﬁnding the representation of the\nlinear projection ˜xwith respect to bthat minimizes the distance between\n˜x−x. From Figure 10.7(b), it is clear that this will be the orthogonal\nprojection, and in the following we will show exactly this.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
