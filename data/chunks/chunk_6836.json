For more details on modeling a univariate time series with an MLP, see Chapter 7.\nThere are many aspects of the MLP that we may wish to tune. We will deﬁne a very simple\nmodel with one hidden layer and deﬁne ﬁve hyperparameters to tune. They are:\n n input: The number of prior inputs to use as input for the model (e.g. 12 months).\n n nodes: The number of nodes to use in the hidden layer (e.g. 50).\n n epochs: The number of training epochs (e.g. 1000).", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 315, "page_label": "299"}}
