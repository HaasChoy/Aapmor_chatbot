For example, consider the\npolynomial kernel (Sch ¨olkopf and Smola, 2002), where the number of\nterms in the explicit expansion grows very quickly (even for polynomials", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
