The fundamental\ntheorem of calculus formalizes the fact that integration and differentiation\nare somehow “inverses” of each other. An intuitive understanding of the\nrule can be obtained by thinking (loosely) about small changes (differen-", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
