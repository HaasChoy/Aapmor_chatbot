Convolutional Neural Network Model 265\nMaking a prediction with the ﬁt CNN model is very much like making a prediction with\nthe ﬁt MLP model in the previous section. The one diﬀerence is in the requirement that we\nspecify the number of features observed at each time step, which in this case is 1. Therefore,\nwhen making a single one-step prediction, the shape of the input array must be: [1, n input,\n1]. The model predict() function below implements this behavior.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 281, "page_label": "265"}}
