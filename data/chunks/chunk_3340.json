We focused on inner products of ﬁnite-dimensional\nvectors. In the following, we will look at an example of inner products of\na different type of vectors: inner products of functions.\nThe inner products we discussed so far were deﬁned for vectors with a\nﬁnite number of entries. We can think of a vectorx∈Rn as function with", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
