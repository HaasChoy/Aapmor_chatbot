An arbitrary number of output values can be speciﬁed, providing\ndirect support for multi-step and even multivariate forecasting.\nFor these capabilities alone, feedforward neural networks may be useful for time series\nforecasting. Implicit in the usage of neural networks is the requirement that there is indeed a\nmeaningful mapping from inputs to outputs to learn.
