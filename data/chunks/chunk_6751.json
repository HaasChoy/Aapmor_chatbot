This means, rather than reading a sequence one step at a time, the\nLSTM would read a block or subsequence of observations at a time using a convolutional\nprocess, like a CNN. This is diﬀerent to ﬁrst reading an extracting features with an LSTM and\ninterpreting the result with an LSTM; this is performing the CNN operation at each time step\nas part of the LSTM.\nThis type of model is called a Convolutional LSTM, or ConvLSTM for short.
