The distribution is indeed bimodal with one peak around 0.3 KW and\nperhaps another around 1.3 KW. There is a long tail on the distribution to higher kilowatt\nvalues. It might open the door to notions of discretizing the data and separating it into peak\n1, peak 2 or long tail. These groups or clusters for usage on a day or hour may be helpful in\ndeveloping a predictive model.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 351, "page_label": "335"}}
