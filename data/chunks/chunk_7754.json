As part of preparing the loaded data,\nwe must ﬂatten the windows and features into one long vector. We can do this with the NumPy\nreshape function and convert the three dimensions of [samples, timesteps, features] into\nthe two dimensions of [samples, timesteps × features]. The load dataset() function\nbelow implements this behavior and returns the train and test X and y elements ready for\nﬁtting and evaluating the deﬁned models.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 501, "page_label": "485"}}
