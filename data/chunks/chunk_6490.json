The sarima forecast() below implements this behavior.\nThe function takes an array or list of contiguous prior observations and a list of conﬁguration\nparameters used to conﬁgure the model, speciﬁcally two tuples and a string for the trend\norder, seasonal order trend, and parameter. We also try to make the model robust by relaxing\nconstraints, such as that the data must be stationary and that the MA transform be invertible.\n# one-step sarima forecast", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 245, "page_label": "229"}}
