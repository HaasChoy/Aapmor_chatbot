We assume that our functionf is differentiable,\nand we are unable to analytically ﬁnd a solution in closed form.\nGradient descent is a ﬁrst-order optimization algorithm. To ﬁnd a local\nminimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps propor-\ntional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
