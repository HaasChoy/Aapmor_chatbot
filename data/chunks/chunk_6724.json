It may make sense to divide the sub-sequences by years, but this is just a\nhypothesis, and other splits could be used, such as six subsequences of six time steps. Therefore,\nthis splitting is parameterized with the n seq and n steps for the number of subsequences and\nnumber of steps per subsequence parameters.\n# reshape input samples", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 292, "page_label": "276"}}
