A concave function is the negative of a convex function. ♦\nconcave function\nThe constraints involving g(·) and h(·) in (7.28) truncate functions at a\nscalar value, resulting in sets. Another relation between convex functions\nand convex sets is to consider the set obtained by “ﬁlling in” a convex\nfunction.
