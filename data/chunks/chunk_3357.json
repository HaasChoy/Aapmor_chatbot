It follows that the segmentπU(x)−x\nfrom πU(x) to xis orthogonal to U, and therefore the basis vector bof\nU. The orthogonality condition yields ⟨πU(x) −x,b⟩= 0 since angles\nbetween vectors are deﬁned via the inner product. λis then the\ncoordinate of πU(x)\nwith respect to b.\nThe projection πU(x) of xonto U must be an element of U and, there-", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
