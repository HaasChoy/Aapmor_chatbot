(11.58)\nWe deﬁne z := [z1,...,z K]⊤ ∈RK as a probability vector consisting of\nK−1 many 0s and exactly one1. For example, forK = 3, a valid zwould\nbe z = [z1,z2,z3]⊤ = [0,1,0]⊤, which would select the second mixture\ncomponent since z2 = 1.\nRemark. Sometimes this kind of probability distribution is called “multi-\nnoulli”, a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution to more than two", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
