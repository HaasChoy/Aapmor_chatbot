Consider vector spaces V,W,X . Then:\nFor linear mappings Φ : V → W and Ψ : W → X, the mapping\nΨ ◦Φ : V →X is also linear.\nIf Φ : V →W is an isomorphism, then Φ−1 : W →V is an isomor-\nphism, too.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
