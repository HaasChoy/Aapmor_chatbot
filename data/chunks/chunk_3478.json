Then the\ngeometric multiplicity of λi is the number of linearly independent eigen-geometric\nmultiplicity vectors associated with λi. In other words, it is the dimensionality of the\neigenspace spanned by the eigenvectors associated with λi.\nRemark. A speciﬁc eigenvalue’s geometric multiplicity must be at least\none because every eigenvalue has at least one associated eigenvector.
