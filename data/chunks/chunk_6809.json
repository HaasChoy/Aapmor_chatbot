Simpler models can be reﬁt with the observation prior to making the subsequent\nprediction. More complex models, such as neural networks, are not reﬁt given the much greater\ncomputational cost. Nevertheless, the true observation for the time step can then be used as\npart of the input for making the prediction on the next time step.\nFirst, the dataset is split into train and test sets.
