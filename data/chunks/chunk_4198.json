Observe that\nif f is a convex function, and α ⩾ 0 is a nonnegative scalar, then the\nfunction αfis convex. We can see this by multiplyingαto both sides of the\nequation in Deﬁnition 7.3, and recalling that multiplying a nonnegative\nnumber does not change the inequality .", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
