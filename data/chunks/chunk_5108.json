Therefore, we apply a subgradient approach for solving it.\nHowever, the hinge loss is differentiable almost everywhere, except for\none single point at the hinge t = 1. At this point, the gradient is a set of\npossible values that lie between 0 and −1. Therefore, the subgradient gof\nthe hinge loss is given by\ng(t) =\n\n\n\n−1 t< 1\n[−1,0] t= 1\n0 t> 1\n.
