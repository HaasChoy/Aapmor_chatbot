In this section we will slowly step through the basics of how and why we need to\nprepare three-dimensional data for CNNs and LSTMs before working through an example in\nthe next section.\nThe input layer for CNN and LSTM models is speciﬁed by the input shape argument on\nthe ﬁrst hidden layer of the network. This too can make things confusing for beginners as\nintuitively we may expect the ﬁrst layer deﬁned in the model be the input layer, not the ﬁrst", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 61, "page_label": "45"}}
