It was used by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis\nto show that when the margin is large, the “complexity” of the function\nclass is low, and hence learning is possible (Vapnik, 2000). It turns out\nthat the concept is useful for various different approaches for theoret-\nically analyzing generalization error (Steinwart and Christmann, 2008;\nShalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014). ♦", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
