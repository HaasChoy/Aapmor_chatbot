We hope that readers will be able to gain a deeper understand-\ning of the basic questions in machine learning and connect practical ques-\ntions arising from the use of machine learning with fundamental choices\nin the mathematical model.\nWe do not aim to write a classical machine learning book. Instead, our\nintention is to provide the mathematical background, applied to four cen-\ntral machine learning problems, to make it easier to read other machine\nlearning textbooks.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
