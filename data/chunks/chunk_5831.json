Multivariate CNN Models 92\nyhat = model.predict(x_input, verbose=0)\nprint(yhat)\nListing 8.10: Example of a CNN model for univariate time series forecasting.\nRunning the example prepares the data, ﬁts the model, and makes a prediction. We can see\nthat the model predicts the next value in the sequence.\nNote: Given the stochastic nature of the algorithm, your speciﬁc results may vary. Consider\nrunning the example a few times.\n[[101.67965]]", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 108, "page_label": "92"}}
