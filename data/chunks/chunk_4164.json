In fact the term ∑N\nn=1(∇Ln(θi))\nin (7.15) is an empirical estimate of the expected value (Section 6.4.1) of\nthe gradient. Therefore, any other unbiased empirical estimate of the ex-\npected value, for example using any subsample of the data, would sufﬁce\nfor convergence of gradient descent.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
