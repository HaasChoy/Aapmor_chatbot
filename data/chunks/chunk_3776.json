This approx-\nimation is locally accurate, but the farther we move away from x0 the\nworse the approximation gets. Equation (5.148) is a special case of a mul-\ntivariate Taylor series expansion of f at x0, where we consider only the\nÔ¨Årst two terms. We discuss the more general case in the following, which\nwill allow for better approximations.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
