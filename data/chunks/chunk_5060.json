Recall that we consider inputs\nx âˆˆRD with D features. Since w is of the same dimension as x, this\nmeans that the number of parameters (the dimension of w) of the opti-\nmization problem grows linearly with the number of features.\nIn the following, we consider an equivalent optimization problem (the\nso-called dual view), which is independent of the number of features.
