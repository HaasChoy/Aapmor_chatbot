The spectral theorem (Theorem 4.15)\nstates that there exists an orthogonal basis, but the one we have is not\northogonal. However, we can construct one.\nTo construct such a basis, we exploit the fact that x1,x2 are eigenvec-\ntors associated with the same eigenvalue λ. Therefore, for any α,β ∈R it\nholds that\nA(αx1 + βx2) = Ax1α+ Ax2β = λ(αx1 + βx2) , (4.40)", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
