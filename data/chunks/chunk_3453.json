However, contemporary approaches in machine learning use direct\nnumerical methods that superseded the explicit calculation of the deter-\nminant. For example, in Chapter 2, we learned that inverse matrices can\nbe computed by Gaussian elimination. Gaussian elimination can thus be\nused to compute the determinant of a matrix.\nDeterminants will play an important theoretical role for the following", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
