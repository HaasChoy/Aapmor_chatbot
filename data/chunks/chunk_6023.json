The CNN\nmodel ﬁrst has a convolutional layer for reading across the subsequence that requires a number\nof ﬁlters and a kernel size to be speciﬁed. The number of ﬁlters is the number of reads or\ninterpretations of the input sequence. The kernel size is the number of time steps included of\neach read operation of the input sequence. The convolution layer is followed by a max pooling", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.18", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "creationdate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "author": "", "title": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "moddate": "2018-11-01T07:53:25+11:00", "trapped": "/False", "ptex.fullbanner": "This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017) kpathsea version 6.2.3", "source": "/home/haas/rag_proj/samples/AAPMOR Website/Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting - Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python (Jason Brownlee) (Z-Library).pdf", "total_pages": 574, "page": 147, "page_label": "131"}}
