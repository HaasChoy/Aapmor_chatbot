In the following, we will have a closer look at speciﬁc orthogonal\ntransformation matrices, which describe rotations.\nA rotation is a linear mapping (more speciﬁcally , an automorphism of rotation\na Euclidean vector space) that rotates a plane by an angle θ about the\norigin, i.e., the origin is a ﬁxed point. For a positive angle θ >0, by com-\nmon convention, we rotate in a counterclockwise direction.
