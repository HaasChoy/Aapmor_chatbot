This mod-\nularity , where the choice of the classiﬁcation method (the SVM) and the\nchoice of the feature representation φ(x) can be considered separately ,\nprovides ﬂexibility for us to explore the two problems independently . In\nthis section, we discuss the representation φ(x) and brieﬂy introduce the\nidea of kernels, but do not go into the technical details.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
