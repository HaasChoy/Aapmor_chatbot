In other\nwords, rotations leave the distance between any two points unchanged\nafter the transformation.\nRotations preserve angles, i.e., the angle betweenRθxand Rθyequals\nthe angle between xand y.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
