Convex differentiable functions such as the examplef(x) = x2 is\na nice special case, where there is no need for the supremum, and there is\na one-to-one correspondence between a function and its Legendre trans-\nform. Let us derive this from Ô¨Årst principles. For a convex differentiable\nfunction, we know that at x0 the tangent touches f(x0) so that\nf(x0) = sx0 + c.
