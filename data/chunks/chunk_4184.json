The reason is that the outer problem (maximization over\nλ) is a maximum over a set of afﬁne functions, and hence is a concave\nfunction, even though f(·) and gi(·) may be nonconvex. The maximum of\na concave function can be efﬁciently computed.\nAssuming f(·) and gi(·) are differentiable, we ﬁnd the Lagrange dual\nproblem by differentiating the Lagrangian with respect to x, setting the\ndifferential to zero, and solving for the optimal value.
