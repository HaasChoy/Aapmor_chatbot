Figure 2.10(a) shows 400 vectors in R2, each of which is represented\nby a dot at the corresponding (x1,x2)-coordinates. The vectors are ar-\nranged in a square. When we use matrixA1 in (2.97) to linearly transform\neach of these vectors, we obtain the rotated square in Figure 2.10(b). If we\napply the linear mapping represented by A2, we obtain the rectangle in", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
