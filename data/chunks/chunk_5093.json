This provides a second avenue, in addition to the soft\nmargin, for users to deal with a dataset that is not linearly separable. It\nturns out that there are many algorithms and statistical methods that have\nthis property that we observed in the dual SVM: the only inner products", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
