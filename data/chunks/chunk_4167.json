Furthermore, large mini-batches take advantage of\nhighly optimized matrix operations in vectorized implementations of the\ncost and gradient. The reduction in variance leads to more stable conver-\ngence, but each gradient calculation will be more expensive.\nIn contrast, small mini-batches are quick to estimate. If we keep the\nmini-batch size small, the noise in our gradient estimate will allow us to\nget out of some bad local optima, which we may otherwise get stuck in.", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
