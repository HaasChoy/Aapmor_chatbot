Independence\ncan be cast as a special case of conditional independence if we writeX ⊥ ⊥\nY |∅. By using the product rule of probability (6.22), we can expand the\nleft-hand side of (6.55) to obtain\np(x,y|z) = p(x|y,z)p(y|z) . (6.56)\nBy comparing the right-hand side of (6.55) with (6.56), we see thatp(y|z)\nappears in both of them so that\np(x|y,z) = p(x|z) .
