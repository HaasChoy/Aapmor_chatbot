Since a solution to a system of linear\nequations must satisfy all equations simultaneously , the solution set is the\nintersection of these lines. This intersection set can be a line (if the linear\nequations describe the same line), a point, or empty (when the lines are\nparallel). An illustration is given in Figure 2.3 for the system\n4x1 + 4x2 = 5\n2x1 −4x2 = 1 (2.8)\nwhere the solution space is the point (x1,x2) = (1,1\n4 ).
