Moreover, we\nwill brieﬂy discuss properties of mappings between these afﬁne spaces,\nwhich resemble linear mappings.\nRemark. In the machine learning literature, the distinction between linear\nand afﬁne is sometimes not clear so that we can ﬁnd references to afﬁne\nspaces/mappings as linear spaces/mappings. ♦", "metadata": {"producer": "pdfTeX-1.40.20", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref", "creationdate": "2019-10-15T12:48:02+01:00", "author": "Marc Peter Deisenroth, A.
