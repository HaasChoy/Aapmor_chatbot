The\nManhattan norm (3.3) is an example of a norm without a corresponding\ninner product. In the following, we will focus on norms that are induced\nby inner products and introduce geometric concepts, such as lengths, dis-\ntances, and angles.\nRemark (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality). For an inner product vector space\n(V,⟨·,·⟩) the induced norm ∥·∥ satisﬁes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality Cauchy-Schwarz\ninequality\n|⟨x,y⟩|⩽∥x∥∥y∥.
