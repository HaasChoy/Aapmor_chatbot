For example, a three-headed\nmodel may have three diﬀerent kernel sizes of 3, 5, 11, allowing the model to read and interpret\nthe sequence data at three diﬀerent resolutions. The interpretations from all three heads are then\nconcatenated within the model and interpreted by a fully-connected layer before a prediction is\nmade.\nWe can implement a multi-headed 1D CNN using the Keras functional API.
